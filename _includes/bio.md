# Biography

I am a final year CS Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in May 2020.
My PhD dissertation focuses on system support 
for machine learning workload. 
In particular, my dissertation addresses the problem of prototyping and scaling 
real-time computer vision applications to augment human cognition on wearable devices and edge clouds ([demos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMP5vmwBuCAg1ezp5_QeDhfHHrmI3xW6S)). 
I built prototype
applications and designed system optimizations to scale video analytics at the edge.
I have over ten publications in top-tier computer system conferences and journals.
Previously, I interned in research and engineering roles at Google, Qualcomm, and Microsoft. 

My PhD advisor is [Prof. Mahadev
Satyanarayanan (Satya)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/). 
You can find my PhD thesis proposal [here](assets/proposal.pdf) and slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1emsF2sAW5hHkqfmRukVYdgsv-5PlN0HzDa1gFLpJMoY/edit?usp=sharing).

<!---
I worked on a
new genre of real-time deep video analytics called **Wearable Cognitive Assistants** .
I aim to apply recent
advancement in mobile and computer vision to blur the boundary between the
physical and virtual world, build portable and intelligent cognitive systems,
and enhance users' abilities to interact with the real world. 


I won the
[Siemens FutureMakers
Challenge](http://news.usa.siemens.biz/press-release/siemens-usa/siemens-leading-us-universities-host-series-rd-challenges-bolster-innovati)
in 2018 to work on development frameworks for creating object detectors with Deep Neural
Networks.
